# Coding challenge Duta Andrei

This is my solution for the coding challenge: Challenge 2: Backend â€“ Predict next 3 values of Stock price (timeseries data)

The solution is developed in Python and consists of 3 files:
- solution.py - the main solution
- get_10_points.py - the first required function
- predict.py - the second required function

## Set up

In order to run the solution, the following requirements should be met:
- The INPUT section of the solution.py file should be edited with the desired values for the 2 variables as instructed in the comments
- A python interpreter should be used to run the solution 

## Usage

To run the project, just run the solution.py file using a python interpreter. 
The outputs files should each be created in the corresponding folder from which the input file was taken.
